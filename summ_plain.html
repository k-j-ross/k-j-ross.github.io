        <h1><center>Curbside | The different ways to explore</center></h1>
        <p>One method for building more accessible things is using many ways of communicating when we build them. I make no promises that what I have provided will be excellent in terms of accessibility, like everyone, I have much to learn. I have tried to provide a range of tools for accessing this work. Below are some points that can help you navigate this rudimentary site based on your access needs and interests. 
        
        </p>   <ul>
        
            <li>The yellow rimmed QR codes will take you to a simple webpage. Here you can access alt text for the timeline and the photos, a plane text summary of my reflections and the full written text that I initially produced for the week.  These are on the bottom left-hand side of each page with a printed summary. They stand out from the page and are encircled in yellow yarn. </li>
             <li> Folks who engage more readily with audio then reading, The QR code in the center bottom of the description pages that are circled in red/orange provide access to audio readings of some of the complete text of the weekly reflections.
                </li>
                <li> For those who are interested in deeper dives and thinking about things from a research perspective I provide links to selected references that I have engaged with and used, and in some cases short one to two sentences summaries. These are encircled in the blue blueberry treated yarn on the right-hand side of each weekly text.
                </li>
                
        </ul>
        <p>
        There is not right way to engage with this work. I hope that using these different modalities and options you can find one that works for you.

        <h3>Description of woven timeline</h3>
        <img src="'timeline" alt="The overall timeline is a seven-foot, 210 cm, long woven strip that is made from woven fabric. The lines that run along the length of the woven fabric are cream colored except for where they create the gridlines for the chart. There are six single strand black gridlines, and at the bottom of the chart is a 1 cm wide black band. The colors that are woven across this lengthwise yarn are in several colors. The beginning of the chart has a mix color pallet, where one strand of golden, rust and purple-blue yarns creates a mixed color. Between this patch and the main chart is a white band that shows the values of the gridlines. Starting with the degrees Celsius of -32,-24,-16,-8,0,8 1nd 16 and the accumulated snow amount of 0,3,6,9,12,15, and 18. To the right of this is the main chart. This chart is divided into six distinct sections for each week of sampling. While each section is made largely of the same gold, rust and purple blue yarns, the color fades and changes over the six weeks. Each day is woven from the yarn for that week and is separated by a thin line of the cream-colored yarn, The gold purple, and red yarns were all exposed to the landscape in the front part of a year, for one week each, and as the time progresses on the chart, they start to slightly change color. The color is paler by the end of the six weeks, and there is some darkening and browning of the yellow gold. Above the chart are a serios of photographs that connect to the days that they were taken with a thin black yarn. Below the chart are several boards that show text, and have QR codes on them. The QR codes are all encircled with yearn of gold, rust and purple blue, from left to right. The photographs and the yarn are used to communicate traces of how the landscape existed in connection to the white cross stich that makes bars on the chart indicating the amount of accumulated snow, and the black line that runs along the length indicating the daily high temperature.
