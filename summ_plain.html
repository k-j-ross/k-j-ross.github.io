    <h2>About </h2>  
   
    <p>This timeline is woven from 100% wool yarn and is comprised of a range of elements. The red, yellow, and blue yarns have been dyed with dye treatments that will change colour when exposed to certain weather conditions. These three colours are all woven together into the whole. The yellow yarn has been treated with turmeric, which our previous testing shows will change color under a range of conditions. The blue yarn treated with blueberries, likewise, will change under a range of water and sunlight condition. To control for sunlight the red yarn treated with beets is used, it stays the same color when exposed to moisture but will fade, eventually completely with exposure to sunlight. Onto this woven background white cross-stitch bars of linin yarn are added to indicate the amount of accumulated snow in cm and a black line is added to indicate the daily high temperature in degrees Celsius. Throughout photographs associated with a given day or week are linked by yarn to the day they were taken, and descriptions of experiences during the week are provided in the text below the timeline. 
    At the end of each week a sample of the yarn from that week hangs down off the timeline to give viewers a sense of the material changes that have been produced by exposure.

   <h2> Curbside | The Different Ways to Explore. </h2>
    <p> One method for building more accessible things is using many ways of communicating when we build them. I make no promises that what I have provided will be excellent in terms of accessibility, like everyone, I have much to learn. I have tried to provide a range of tools for accessing this work. Below are some points that can help you navigate this rudimentary site based on your access needs and interests.

    <ul>
    <li>	<p>The companion simple webpage can be access via the QR code on the first panel, or the tiny url link.</li> 
    </p>
        <li>	<p>Each week has both a plain text summary as well as a full version of the text and audio recording. </li>

    <h2>The Dying Process and the Rational for the Dye Selection.</h2>
    <p><em>Testing:</em> In the fall of 2021 I worked with Willett to test a range of dye treatments for materials that are known to have fugitive dye properties. Fugitive dyes are dye treatments which chemically react to things light exposure, PH and water or moisture leading to a change in color. In our tests we trialed 14 distinct dye materials ranging from local produce to common natural dye plants. In both the initial tests and this project, we used wool yarn. Examining The types of variation in treatment used for the 14 distinct dye colors included testing both with and without an alum mordant on the yarn prior to its treatment and pH shifting of the dye liquor. The PH shift was done for treatments like the turmeric which has a color shift in both the acid and basic direction. Based on our experimentation in 2021 the properties of the chosen dyes of blueberry, beet, and turmeric were observed to show color change  that map to exposure to light, moisture, and pH changes. The initial testing involved weaving yarns dyed by the 37 treatments into 5 distinct strips that were subjected to experimental treatments. The treatments for testing were: 1) Placed in a sunny window for 2 weeks. 2) Rinsed with water twice daily for 2 weeks. 3) Rinsed in an acidic bath with a pH of ` 5 twice daily for 2 weeks. 4) Rinsed in a basic bath 2 with an acidity of approximately 9 twice daily for two weeks. One test strip was kept as a control. From this Ross and Willett established that Beet as a dye material is highly fugitive in light, disappearing when a significant amount of light is present, and shows a hue change in basic conditions. Both the blueberry and the turmeric showed hue and saturation changes across the four treatments. All three of the chosen dyes fade in sunlight, but the beet showed the most significant changes in light. </p>
    
<p>The decisions of colors to use in this project were based on the availability of materials at the time of creation and their local production. While blueberry is natively extant in the region, both beet and turmeric are grown here as introduced cultivated species. The colors created, blue, yellow, and rust, are intended to highlight the interactions and landscape connections between snow and ice (blue) sun (yellow) and dormant plant matter like dogwood (rust orange). In this case the turmeric was dyed in an acid shifted dye liquor while both beet and blueberry were dyed in a neutral pH water. All the dyed yarns used in this project were wool and were mordanted using an alum pre mordant. The black lines in the textiles warp are colored using a logwood dye premeditated with alum and after-mordanted in an iron bath. The mass of dye based on weight of fiber for the beet dye is 200%, for the blueberry is 50% and for the turmeric is 20%. </p>   
    <p> <em>Future work:</em>TThis project used previously established testing for reasons of timing and availability. However, future work is called for that creates deeper connections to local landscape materials and natural dye changes. Following harvesting and wildcrafting protocols this should not be done without considering the ecological resilience and population of the species being examined. Materials such as elderberry or strawberry blight may provide other sources that can also create an ecological depth to future work that is not attained in this piece.    </p>

            <h3>Description of woven timeline</h3>
            <img src="Images/Full gradiation visable.jpg" width=100% alt="The overall timeline is a seven-foot, 210 cm, long woven strip that is made from woven fabric. The lines that run along the length of the woven fabric are cream colored except for where they create the gridlines for the chart. There are six single strand black gridlines, and at the bottom of the chart is a 1 cm wide black band. The colors that are woven across this lengthwise yarn are in several colors. The beginning of the chart has a mix color pallet, where one strand of golden, rust and purple-blue yarns creates a mixed color. Between this patch and the main chart is a white band that shows the values of the gridlines. Starting with the degrees Celsius of -32,-24,-16,-8,0,8 1nd 16 and the accumulated snow amount of 0,3,6,9,12,15, and 18. To the right of this is the main chart. This chart is divided into six distinct sections for each week of sampling. While each section is made largely of the same gold, rust and purple blue yarns, the color fades and changes over the six weeks. Each day is woven from the yarn for that week and is separated by a thin line of the cream-colored yarn, The gold purple, and red yarns were all exposed to the landscape in the front part of a year, for one week each, and as the time progresses on the chart, they start to slightly change color. The color is paler by the end of the six weeks, and there is some darkening and browning of the yellow gold. Above the chart are a serios of photographs that connect to the days that they were taken with a thin black yarn. Below the chart are several boards that contain the same text as this site. The photographs and the yarn are used to communicate traces of how the landscape existed in connection to the white cross stich that makes bars on the chart indicating the amount of accumulated snow, and the black line that runs along the length indicating the daily high temperature.
