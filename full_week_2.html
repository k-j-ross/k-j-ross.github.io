<h1><center> Week 2: January fifteenth to <twenty-first></twenty-first> </center></h1>
<div>
<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p>The biggest thing I noticed this week was how the people around me make it possible to live with a disability. My family of course, but also neighbours as well. When I am in my own neighbourhood, there is more access to places than I have once I get onto the bus. I do not know if this is the same for other people. 

</p>
<p>
    The other thing that I noticed was that there are many people who are worried about water, dryness, and drought. Some people talk to me more with a cane, others talk to me less. But many people I do talk to are worried about there not being enough snow.

<h2>Full text for week 2</h2>
<p>The flavor of my experience this week can be summarised in a journey to a bus stop. A story of social infrastructure, troubled but also beautiful. 
</p>
<p>
    The air is still bitter cold, the snow is fresh. I head out, round the corner and head down the street; we waited a long time for winter. The long December dryness still weighs on me. I am slowly making it to my bus stop, there is a row of people out shoveling. They see me coming. A thin line of cleared sidewalk emerges, a path through to the bottom of the hill. I pass one of my neighbours not my head and say thanks and have a good day. He says, ‘it sure is good to see the snow it’s been far too dry.’ ‘I agree’ I say, ‘my heart hurts thinking about the drought.’ I know’ he says, ‘I also have been worried’.  I have noticed that walking with my cane can either create a barrier to interaction or enable it. This conversation is an echo of many random conversations from December. All the passing comments of ‘I’m loving getting out and walking in this weather, but I am worried about what is happening, this is December, the ground is too dry, this is not normal.’ 
</p>
<p>
    As the snow falls it feels like there is a multitudinal sigh of relief: moisture! 
</p>
<p>
    The air stabs my lungs with every breath, I reach my bus stop, the snowplough has made a pile of snow between the road and the sidewalk. Snow that I will have to step through to board my bus. My neighbours have gotten me here, now the mechanical infrastructure of car centering is my last barrier to overcome to move to my next destination.
</p>
<p>
    I find my heart reeling with a mix of climate grief, disability grief, and pleasure. I struggle to articulate this second grief, for it is less grief at my changed body — this is a thing that living around disability for my whole life has prepared me for— than it is a grief associate with noticing how this change leads to slow and subtle exclusions. It is a grief at knowing that my experience of community and social infrastructure is not universal.
</p>
<p>
    But I must also attend to the self to stay stable in a world that creates hierarchies of human worthiness. I give a general attention at the landscape I am in. I tune in, I notice. For all the weariness I feel, the dominant feeling is joy. For me right now, snow is a physical barrier and snow is the key to life. The social infrastructure of my community — the small paths cleared — makes that barrier just a little bit less pronounced and gives me room to share in the exaltation of water. Where I lose ease of access is where community fades into some semblance of ‘that is someone else’s responsibility.’ 
</p>
<p>
    I am left waiting for my bus and asking myself, what is my responsibility in this?

<h2> Images and description for week 2</h2>
<h3>Description of woven timeline</h3>
<img src="week2" alt="The graph shows that on this week there was the most snow on the ground of any week of the project. Starting at 10 cm on Monday and reaching a maximum of 16 cm on the Thursday of the week. The high temperature ranges between around 6 degrees below Celsius and around 16 degrees below Celsius for the whole week. Following a snowfall mid week, the snow accumulation remains significant. ">

<h3> Description of the first photo for the week</h3>
<img src="'week2" alt="The first selected photograph for this week comes from Monday January 15th. In the image there is a long dry sidewalk stretching out towards a road and the bright blue horizon.  On the left of the sidewalk is a mound of snow from the sidewalk being shoveled. To the right there is a large mount of snow running the length of the sidewalk separating the sidewalk from the road. The mound between the sidewalk and the road is higher than the accumulated snow amount. While there is 10 cm of accumulated snow, the mound is closer to 15 cm tall. This is the mound I must step over to get on my bus." >

<h3>Description of the second photo for the week</h3>
<img src="'week1" alt="The second photo is from January 17th. It is of a huge mound of snow separating a very snow sidewalk from an equally snow road. The distinction between the different infrastructure is difficult to make as the big mound of snow is 60-70 cm across. " >
