<div title="Summary">
<h2 title="Week two plain language summary ">Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p title="Week 2 plain language summary">The biggest thing I noticed this week was how the people around me make it possible to live with a disability. My family of course, but also neighbours as well. When I am in my own neighbourhood, there is more access to places than I have once I get onto the bus. I do not know if this is the same for other people. The other thing that I noticed was that there are many people who are worried about water, dryness, and drought. Some people talk to me more with a cane, others talk to me less. But many people I do talk to are worried about there not being enough snow.

In the image there is a long dry sidewalk stretching out towards a road and the bright blue horizon.  On the left of the sidewalk is a mound of snow from the sidewalk being shoveled. To the right there is a large mount of snow running the length of the sidewalk separating the sidewalk from the road. The mound between the sidewalk and the road is higher than the accumulated snow amount. While there is 10 cm of accumulated snow, the mound is closer to 15 cm tall. This is the mound I must step over to get on my bus."

<h2 title="Full text week 2">Full text for week two</h2>
<p title="journy to a bus stop">My experience this week can be summarised in a journey to a bus stop. A story of social infrastructure, troubled but also beautiful. 
</p>
<p title="Chat with a neighbour">  The air is still bitter, the snow is fresh. I head out, round the corner and head down the street; we waited a long time for winter. The dryness of 2023 still weighs on me. I am slowly making it to my bus stop, there is a row of people out shoveling. They see me coming. A thin line of cleared sidewalk emerges, a path through to the bottom of the hill. I pass one of my neighbours, nod my head, and say thanks and have a good day. We exchange pleasantries noting drought and precipitation. 
</p>  
<p title="collective relief">
    As the snow falls it feels like there is a multitudinal sigh of relief: moisture! 
    </p>
    <p title="waiting and wondering">
I am left waiting for my bus and asking what is my responsibility in this?

<h3>Description of woven timeline</h3>
<img src="Images/Week 1 and 2 photo.jpg" width=100% alt=" The photo here shows week and week two. The graph in week 2 shows that on this week there was the most snow on the ground of any week of the project. Starting at 10 cm on Monday and reaching a maximum of 16 cm on the Thursday of the week. The daily high temperature ranges between around 6 degrees below Celsius and around 16 degrees below Celsius for the whole week. This is shown by the black line that runs along the graph. Following a snowfall mid week, the snow accumulation remains significant as shown by the large white cross-stitched bars on the rust hugged multicolored background. "</img>
