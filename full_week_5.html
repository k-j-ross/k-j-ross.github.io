    <h1><center> Week 5: February fifth to eleventh </center></h1>
<div>
<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p>
    This week I tried to notice the things that were beautiful. I found that moving slowly helps with this. But I also noticed that because I move slowly this kind of noticing seems to put me even more at odds with the expectations of the world.

<h2>Full text for week five</h2>


<p>
    How can I tell you about the beauty I have noticed this week because of my slow wanderings to and from the bus? How can I write about how slow wandering tunes me into my breath, my heart, my life, reasserting bodily awareness? This slowness that moves me into and through that which is difficult.  How can I tell you of these things without you walking away thinking that it makes all the other stuff ok? 
</p>

<p>
    You will choose.
</p>
<p>
    To move slowly is as much a way of being in the world as any other, it is one I enjoy. It is also radical in a world that values busy, in a world that wants rush, in a world that pretends I can be a superhero. This week, I had the privilege of reveling in moving ponderously. In my sore fatigue, it was necessary and tiring, but in my sore fatigue it was also welcome. 
</p>
<p>
    Slowness this week meant noticing the very granules of snow that clings to last yearâ€™s lilac seeds. Because I must take my time, I notice more readily the way that light glistens off ice perched on plants across the landscape. Slow means noticing how the visual metaphor of a glacier can be found in a 1-foot square. Slow means noticing the beauty of a tree through a campus door window while everyone else rushes by. On Monday I look, for about 3 minutes, on this tree out the window between the ICT tower and the Engineering block at the University of Calgary; it is stunning. 
</p>
<p>
    My pace of living is out of sync with the world; how much I wish I could gently hold a moment with each frazzled soul that passes and simply say, you are enough just by being. I would tell them to stop worrying about becoming someone because you already are someone. I would critique busy culture, hustle culture, aspirational culture, but this would be unfair. It is a black hole whose gravitational pull is impossible to avoid. With enough healing, I too will be pulled into its gravitational well. So, I think critique of the rush is fruitless, instead I grieve. Water is a barrier in my movement through space and it is spectacular. What would shift in our hearts if we had the time to breathe in and revel both truths? How many of us would be just as content doing the same work, but slower? How few of us have that choice? Speed is an abled privilege. The hustle keeps me out of full participation.

    Cane step, step. <br>
I walk towards the place where I will meet a friend. <br>
Cane step, step.<br>
When did we replace living with doing?<br>
Cane step, step.<br>
Ha, look at that crow on the snowy pine, it is divine!<br>

    <h3>Description of woven timeline</h3>
    <img src="week5" alt=" On the graph we see snow beginning to accumulate again and temperatures drop back down to slightly below freezing. By Friday there is another big snowfall, with small amounts accumulating prior to this.  The background weaving is starting to show more changes, the Turmeric has some patches of brown, visible when the yarn is examined but less so in the woven fabric. The blueberry dye is starting to change into many colors, blue, green, grey, all indicative of water, sun, and melt. The red dye, which only fades with sunlight exposure is continuing to light. With the occasional shot of white rather than red yearn present in the textile. ">

    <img src="'week5" alt="Photo 1 February 7th: 
    In this photo there is a close of lilac seeds, these seeds have pods that are longer than they are wide, and they are tan in color. Snow is accumulating and clung onto the tops of these seeds. It is dusting them on top while the golden tan shines out underneath.

    <h3>Description of the second photo for the week</h3>
    <img src="'week5" alt=" Photo   2: February 7th: This photo is a close up of mounded snow by the side of the road. This tiny amount of snow has cracks and crevices in it.  On the right-hand side of the image a dark crack runs though the little mound of snow. On the left the brightness of the snow is apparent in it luminescent white.  " >
