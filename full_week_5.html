<div>
<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p>
    This week I tried to notice the things that were beautiful. I found that moving slowly helps with this. But I also noticed that because I move slowly this kind of noticing seems to put me even more at odds with the expectations of the world.

    In this photo there is a close of lilac seeds, these seeds have pods that are longer than they are wide, and they are tan in color. Snow is accumulating and clung onto the tops of these seeds. It is dusting them on top while the golden tan shines out underneath.

<h2>Full text for week five</h2>


<p title="Awe">
    How can I tell you about the beauty I have noticed this week because of my slow wanderings to and from the bus? How can I write about how slow wandering tunes me into my breath, my heart, my life, reasserting bodily awareness? This slowness that moves me into and through that which is difficult. How can I tell you of these things without you walking away thinking that it makes the other stuff ok?</p>

<p title="You will choose">
    You will choose.
</p>
<p title="Mving slowly">
    To move slowly is as valid a way of being in the world as any other, it is one I enjoy. It is also radical in a world that values busy, in a world that wants rush, in a world that pretends I can be a superhero.</p>
<p title="Noticing">
    Slowness this week meant noticing the very granules of snow that cling to last yearâ€™s lilac seeds. Slow means noticing how the visual metaphor of a glacier can be found in a 1-foot square. </p>
<p title=""Speed is an abeled privladge>
    My pace of living is out of sync with the world; how much I wish I could gently hold a moment with each frazzled soul that passes. I would critique busy culture, hustle culture, aspirational culture, but this would be unfair. It is a black hole whose gravitational pull is impossible to avoid. I too will be pulled into its gravitational well again someday. So, critique of the rush is fruitless, instead I grieve. Speed is an abled privilege. The hustle keeps me out of full participation.</p>
<p "replacing livign with dooing">

When did we replace living with doing?

    <h3>Description of woven timeline</h3>
    <img src="Images/Week 5 front right.jpg"  width=100% alt=" On the graph we see snow beginning to accumulate again and temperatures drop back down to slightly below freezing. By Friday there is another big snowfall, with small amounts accumulating prior to this.  The background weaving is starting to show more changes, the Turmeric has some patches of brown, visible when the yarn is examined but less so in the woven fabric. The blueberry dye is starting to change into many colors, blue, green, grey, all indicative of water, sun, and melt. The red dye, which only fades with sunlight exposure is continuing to light. With the occasional shot of white rather than red yearn present in the textile. ">
