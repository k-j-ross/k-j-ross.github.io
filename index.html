<h1><center>Curbside | Weaving, water, and disability</center></h1>
<p>Curbside: is a personal exploration of (dis)ability and (im)mobility in wintertime Calgary that uses textiles, texts, and photographs to weave together self and the environment. It connects quantitative information about snow and temperature with traces of environmental conditions using dyed yarns and photographs. Interlaced throughout are also theoretically grounded reflections in prose and poetry about the disability and its plurality in interrelations with water, snow, and ice.

<p>
    The dyed yarn used in the timeline traces environmental exposure to water and light through both subtle and significant changes in color. Each week of yarn exposure is then woven into the timeline along with the yarns subtle and significant changes. The integration of reflections and photographs further highlight, destabilize, and trouble our perceptions of disability and how they come to be in relationship with landscape and water to construct mobilities. Curbside connects quantitative information about snow accumulation amounts with traces of the same phenomenon using both these yarns and the photographic elements. This is interlaced with reflections in prose and poetry about the experiences of disability and all of their plural interrelations with water, snow, and ice.
