<p>One method for building more accessible things is using many ways of communicating when we build them. I make not promises that what I have provided will be excellent in terms of accessibility, like everyone, I have much to learn. I have tried to provide a range of tools for accesses this work. Below are some points that can help you navigate this rudimentary site based on your access needs and interests. 

</p>   <ul>

<li>For people who benefit from reading less complex English I provide plane text in the yellow rimmed QR codes. These are on the bottom left-hand side of each page with a printed summary.  Or in the links in the plain English summary section.  
</li>
<li>For people who need to use a text to screen reader for descriptions of the display I provide the full version of text in the QR codes floating at the bottom of the piece.
The height above the ground of these QR codes indicates the weeks average snow on the ground. There is alt text for all photos, and a description of the graph elements as well as a full text version of the snippets used on the display. All of the web content has been left in simple HTML form to ensure that the use of screen.
</li>
<li> Folks who engage more readily with audio then reading, The QR code in the center bottom of the description pages that are circled in red/orange provide access to audio readings of some of the complete text.
</li>
<li> Those who are interested in deeper dives and thinking about things from a research perspective I provide links to references that I have engaged with and used, and in some cases short summaries of their impact on me. These are encircled in the blue blueberry treated yarn on the right hand side of each weekly text.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is not right way to engage with this work. I hope that using these different modalities and options you can find one that works for you.
