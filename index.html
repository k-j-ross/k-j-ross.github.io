<h1>Curbside| multiple ways to explore</h1>
<p>An important part of making things accesable to everyone is providing different modalities for interaction, 

- I make not promises that what I have provided will be excelent in terms of accesabiliyt, I have tried to provideda range of access
points to ensure all who want to engage can.

- For people who benifit from reading less complex english I provide plane text in the yellow rimmed QR codes. These are on the bottom left hand side of each weeks summary. 

-For people who need to use a text to screen reader for descriptions of the display I provide the full version of text in the QR codes floating at the bottom of the peice.
The hight above the ground of these QR codes indicates the weeks average snow on the ground. There is alt text for all phottos, and a description of the graph elements as well as a full text version of the snippits used on the display. All of the web content has been left in simple HTML form to ensure that the use of screa

-For folks who engage more readaly with audio then reading, The qr code in the center bottom of the description pages that are circled in red/orange provide access to audio readings of some of the complete text.

-For Those who are intersted in deeper dives and thinking about things from a reseach perspective I provide links to referances that I have engaged with and used, and in some cases short summaries of their impact on me. These are encircled in the blu blubery treated yarn on the right hand side of each pages

There is not right way to engage with this work. I hope that with all of these differnt modalities and oprtions you can find one that works for you.

<p>In the first week, I found that I was very scared by the cold. Because of the wounds on my legs, the cold to hurt me more. While walking I was worried about the ice, I was more worried about the cold. This was new to me and made me miss how i used to feel my legs cool off when I would walk in the winter. I found I missed that feeling because it reminded me of what I use to feel.
