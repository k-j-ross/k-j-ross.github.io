<h1>Simple text version of week 1</h1>

<p>In the first week, I found that I was very scared by the cold. Because of the wounds on my legs, the cold to hurt me more. While walking I was worried about the ice, I was more worried about the cold. This was new to me and made me miss how i used to feel my legs cool off when I would walk in the winter. I found I missed that feeling because it reminded me of what I use to feel.
