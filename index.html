<h1><center>Curbside | Weaving, water, and disability</center></h1>
<p> Curbside is a personal exploration of (dis)ability and (im)mobility in wintertime Calgary. I use textiles, texts, and photographs to weave together self and the environment. Curbside connects quantitative data about snow and temperature with traces of environmental conditions using dyed wool yarns and photographs. Interlaced throughout are theoretically grounded autobiographical reflections about disability. These reflections focus on how landscape forms and interacts with disability in ways that are informed by water, snow, and ice. It embodies how different forms of data such as quantitative weather data, material traces, and personal stories can work together. Curbside is an example of highly personal data art that illuminates local systems in thoughtful ways.

<p>
    The dyed yarn used in the timeline traces environmental exposure to water and light through both subtle and significant changes in color. Each week of yarn exposure is then woven into the timeline along with the yarns subtle and significant changes. The integration of reflections and photographs further highlight, destabilize, and trouble our perceptions of disability and how they come to be in relationship with landscape and water to construct mobilities. Curbside connects quantitative information about snow accumulation amounts with traces of the same phenomenon using both these yarns and the photographic elements. This is interlaced with reflections in prose and poetry about the experiences of disability and all of their plural interrelations with water, snow, and ice.
