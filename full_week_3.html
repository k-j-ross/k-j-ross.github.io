<h1>full week 3</h1>


<p>Ice and instability on it are to often mistake as a product of deep cold. They are not. This week I find myself traversing a landscape that abounds with slick winter flowing over patches of ice.<br>
    Walking becomes an act of trying, and failing, to find connection between something solid and my feet.<br> 
    
    Cane, step, wobble, step.<br>
    
    Cane, step, slip, step<br>
    
    Fluid water makes the ice slick, and this fluidity brings an unexpected level of fatigue. When it is not ice it is slush, mud and slush, mounds of slush. The sidewalks and the roads distinguished by slush. 
    Midway through the week I find my left leg tense, sore, tight, and weary. The instability takes a new toll on my body. I only have time to notice the world around me when I am standing still. Such truth creates a tension between being and noticing. I am being in movement, but the main noticing is of the direct contact point, not the world I am moving through. But this to is a false binary, for that direct context point, the place I put my next foot, it to is a microcosm of the larger world.
