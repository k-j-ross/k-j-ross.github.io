    <h1><center> Week 3: January twenty-second to twenty-eighth </center></h1>
<div>
<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p>
    This week was exhausting. It was very icy because it was warm. There was a lot of ice and slush. By the end of the week my legs were very tired.

<h2>Full text for week three</h2>


<p>Iceâ€” our instability on it is frequently mistaken as a product of deep cold. It is not. This week I find myself traversing a landscape that abounds with slick water, water flowing over patches of ice.</p>
    <p>
    Cane, step, wobble, step.<br>
    </p><p>
    Cane, step, slip, step<br>
    </p><p>
        Fluid water makes the ice slick, unreachable, and this fluidity brings an unexpected level of fatigue. When it is not ice it is slush, mud and slush, mounds of slush. The sidewalks and the roads distinguished from each other by slush. 
</p>
<p>
    Midway through the week I find my left leg tense, sore, tight, and weary. The instability takes a new toll on my body. I only have time to notice the world around me when I am standing still. This creates a tension between being and noticing. I am being in movement, but the main noticing is of the direct contact point, not the world I am moving through. But this too is a false binary, for that direct contact point, the place I focus on as I place my feet, is a microcosm of the larger world.

    <img src="'week3" alt=" This second image is also taken from January 24th. It is an image that looks down the road and across a large amount of pooled and melting water. The pooled water is reflecting the blue sky. Between the road and the pools of water and the sidewalk, which is visible on the left-hand side of the image is a big pile of slush separating the roadway from the sidewalk at the curbside. " >
