<h1>Plain Language Summary: </h1>
<p>

Disability is something that can happen to anyone at any time. 
When we talk about disability there are often things we leave out. 
We do not address how people are disabled by systems.  
When we are aleays safe we may not think about disability in terms of people fleeing from war or disater. 
When people are safe they may not think about war and hatred as somthing that creates disabiliyt. 
My reflections say very little about disabiliyt and water as somthign that is global. 
So, I am sharing them because they are my experience and my experiences alone. 
Even in this single story I hope you find a reflection of how people interact with their world. I
 hope you walk away thinking not just about disability but also the ways that  we create disability by the way we make our world.

In June 2023 I was injured and ended up very sick and had to spend a long time in the hospital. 
Getting very sick and almost dying caused me to have sever injury to my left leg, after six months I am still relearning how to walk. I feel very lucky that I was cared for so well. I also very sad that others do not receive the same care.

    <h1>Introducroty essay </h1>
    <p>
       <b>Experiences of mobility and disability are rooted in place, time, and positionality. Local infrastructures, social, physical, and emotional make us variously disabled, they make us variously mobile.
    </b> 
      
    </p>
    <p>
     My (im)mobility is only one of these experiences. It is mediated by how landscape interacts with water. I do not use a car. I did not before I became physically disabled, and I do not now. So, as a researcher of data visualization and active mobility, I am curious about disability, snow and ice and the context of micromobility in the global north. I am curious about micro-level phenomenon: the water on my sidewalk, the rivulets at the curbside. 

    </p>

    <p>
        While (dis)ability and (im)mobility are global realities, we still live in a world where only some people who have experienced disabling infrastructures are regularly heard. Global north voices. Voices like mine.

        Use my story as presented here to consider disabled encounters with water that involve trying to escape war, trying to escape persecution, trying to get to safety. Ponder living in contexts where disabled care and dignity are viewed as essential for collective thriving. Reflect on the assumptions you make about the experiences of all disabled bodies and particularly those of the global majority. 
 
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you assume a singular story? 

    </p>
    <P>
        This is  one journey; it does not reflect the multitudes of daily water mediated disabled journeys.
