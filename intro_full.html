<h1>Plain Language Summary: </h1>
<p>

    Disability is something that can happen to anyone at any time. 
    When we talk about disability there are often things we leave out. 
    We do not address how people are disabled by systems.  
    When we are safe and abled we may not think about disability in terms of people fleeing from war or disaster. 
    When people are safe they may not think about war and hatred as something that creates disability. 
    My reflections say extraordinarily little about disability and water as something that is global. 
    So, I am sharing them because they are my experience and my experiences alone. 
    Even in this single story I hope you find a reflection of how people interact with their world. I
     hope you walk away thinking not just about disability but also the ways that we create disability by the way we make our world.

In June 2023 I was injured and ended up very sick and had to spend a long time in the hospital. 
Getting very sick and almost dying caused me to have sever injury to my left leg, after six months I am still relearning how to walk. I feel very lucky that I was cared for so well. I also very sad that others do not receive the same care.

    <h1>Introductory personal essay </h1>
    <p>
       <b>Experiences of mobility and disability are rooted in place, time, and positionality. Local infrastructures, social, physical, and emotional make us variously disabled, they make us variously mobile.
    </b> 
      
    </p>
    <p>
     My (im)mobility is only one of these experiences. It is mediated by how landscape interacts with water. I do not use a car. I did not before I became physically disabled, and I do not now. So, as a researcher of data visualization and active mobility, I am curious about disability, snow and ice and the context of micromobility in the global north. I am curious about micro-level phenomenon: the water on my sidewalk, the rivulets at the curbside. 

    </p>

    <p>
        While (dis)ability and (im)mobility are global realities, we still live in a world where only some people who have experienced disabling infrastructures are regularly heard. Global north voices. Voices like mine. 


    </p>
    <p>
        Use my story as presented here to consider disabled encounters with water that involve trying to escape war, trying to escape persecution, trying to get to safety. Ponder living in contexts where disabled care and dignity are viewed as essential for collective thriving. Reflect on the assumptions you make about the experiences of all disabled bodies and particularly those of the global majority. 
 
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you assume a singular story? 

    </p>
    <P>
        This is  one journey; it does not reflect the multitudes of daily water mediated disabled journeys.

    </P>
    <p> <b> My experience with disability is not universal, there is no normative body, so my experience is not representative.

        In early June 2023 while hiking with a friend I slipped on a root. I did not fall but I did role my ankle. I heard it pop. I wrapped it up and hobbled out. At the hospital it was confirmed that my ankle was broken. This led to a blood clot in my right leg.

    </p>
    <p>
        On June 21, 2023, I became weak and short of breath and was admitted to the Foothills Hospital for a minor pulmonary embolism.

    </p>
    <p>
        On June 23, 2023, as my nurse was taking my vitals, I had a massive pulmonary embolism. My heart stopped. I underwent 30 minutes of CPR. My heart stopped again, more CPR and massive emergency surgery. My family was given only seconds to say goodbye. I was not expected to live. 

    </p>
    <p>
        I know I would not be alive today if I did not fight for and cling to life: <br>	
	I did not go gently into that good night.<br>
But would I be alive if … <br>

I have no control over other people and how they work in systems. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Damaged leg arteries, damaged nerves. A machine that acted as my heart for weeks —pumping my blood because my body could not. Massive infection with a superbug. Kidney failure. A leg cut open to save it from amputation. When I came back into the world as we know it, I was transformed. 

    </p>
    <p>
        What was obvious, both from living through bodily death, and from the efforts taken to keep me alive is that my existence is rooted in luck and privilege. Luck that my nurse was present when my embolism occurred. Luck that I was born in a country with public health care. Luck, and privilege that my emergency room doctor believed me. Privilege in that when ill I did not need to be moved, to run from fire, to flee violence, to escape flood. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Luck and privilege rooted in global histories.  

    </p>
    <p>
        My weeks of living through dying were some of the worst weeks of my life. My recovery has been hard. As I healed in the fall, I faced winter with growing dread. How would my life and movement be constrained as snow and ice arrived? I feared I would feel trapped and cut off from the world. 

    </p>
    <p>
        I can hold care for myself and my struggle very deeply and name that my life exists today from a place of interwoven factors of local and global history.  The quality skin grafting done on my leg is a product, in part, of unethical biomedical testing on Inuit bodies. The access to clean water that flows through this land allowed my wounds to stay clean. My care is a product of colonial and exploitive histories that have produced medical care as we know it in this place. 

    </p>
    <p>
        My fear of isolation too is a product of these histories. 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>My gratitude for life can not change the past or the present. We must see the indignities that have been, and those that are unfolding, to transform the future.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I invite you to join me, <br>
in play, in grief, in discovery, <br>
in reflection, in exploration, in awe.  <br>
I invite you to stand with me,  <br><br>

        <h2> Images and description for week 1</h2>
        <h3>Description of woven timeline</h3>
        <img src="'timeline" alt="The overall timeline is a seven-foot, 210 cm, long woven strip that is made from woven fabric. The lines that run along the length of the woven fabric are cream colored except for where they create the gridlines for the chart. There are six single strand black gridlines, and at the bottom of the chart is a 1 cm wide black band. The colors that are woven across this lengthwise yarn are in several colors. The beginning of the chart has a mix color pallet, where one strand of golden, rust and purple-blue yarns creates a mixed color. Between this patch and the main chart is a white band that shows the values of the gridlines. Starting with the degrees Celsius of -32,-24,-16,-8,0,8 1nd 16 and the accumulated snow amount of 0,3,6,9,12,15, and 18. To the right of this is the main chart. This chart is divided into six distinct sections for each week of sampling. While each section is made largely of the same gold, rust and purple blue yarns, the color fades and changes over the six weeks. Each day is woven from the yarn for that week and is separated by a thin line of the cream-colored yarn, The gold purple, and red yarns were all exposed to the landscape in the front part of a year, for one week each, and as the time progresses on the chart, they start to slightly change color. The color is paler by the end of the six weeks, and there is some darkening and browning of the yellow gold. Above the chart are a serios of photographs that connect to the days that they were taken with a thin black yarn. Below the chart are several boards that show text, and have QR codes on them. The QR codes are all encircled with yearn of gold, rust and purple blue, from left to right. The photographs and the yarn are used to communicate traces of how the landscape existed in connection to the white cross stich that makes bars on the chart indicating the amount of accumulated snow, and the black line that runs along the length indicating the daily high temperature.
