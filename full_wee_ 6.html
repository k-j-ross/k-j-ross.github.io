<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p title=""How I feel at the end">
    I finished the project looking at how water impacts the yarns I dyed. I also end thinking about what disability means to me. Disability can be hard. Disability is not bad.

<h2>Full text for week Six </h2>

<p title="boundies of disability">
    As I arrive at the end of my exploration I am beginning to walk unaided indoors. This has left me pondering the boundaries and borders we place on (dis)abledness.
</p>
<p title="Change needs attention">
Changes sometimes need attention. The yarns in this project changed, and when woven into fabric that change is almost imperceptible. Things seem consistent when separate parts are woven together, but change is glaring when seen as a singular. Perhaps, transformation can be most noticeable when the whole is deconstructed. Perhaps, the truth is most accessible when we view the whole. I have learned the value of attending to noticing. I have learned the value of attending to noticing what I choose to notice.</p>
<p title="Disabled life is life">
It is troubling and exhilarating to experience the world as a disabled person. It is, like all life, living.
</p>

<p title="Disabiliyt is not a bad word">
    Disability is what the world gives to us, disability is not rooted in the self but in culture. And disability is not a bad word.
