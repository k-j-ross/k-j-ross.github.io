<h1> <center>  Week 6:  February 12th to 18th</center></h1>
<div>
<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p>
    I finished the project looking at how water impacts the yarns I dyed. I also end thinking about what disability means to me. Disability can be hard. Disability is not bad.

<h2>Full text for week Six </h2>

<p>
As I arrive at the end of my exploration I am beginning to walk unaided indoors. This has left me pondering the boundaries and borders we place on (dis)abledness. 
</p><p>
The yarns I used to sense the changes in weather have done what I expected. The yarn faded from the sunlight for the red beet treatment. For the blueberry yarn it changed spottily into shades of blue and blue green from water and alkaline exposure, and slowly faded with the sun. With the turmeric treated yarn there has been some patchy browning indicative of alkali exposure.
</p><p>
Changes sometimes need attention. The yarns in this project changed, and when woven into fabric that change is almost imperceptible. Things seem consistent when separate parts are woven together, but change is glaring when seen as a singular. Perhaps transformation can be most noticeable when the whole is deconstructed. Perhaps the truth is most accessible when we view the whole. I have learned the value of attending to noticing. I have learned the value of attending to noticing what I chose to notice.

<p>
It is troubling and exhilarating to experience the world as a disabled person. It is, like all life, living.
</p><p>
The land changes, the background fades, the picture comes into focus. My words create shapes around my ideas, time moves. I think on sharing this work with increasing perplexity.
</p><p>
It is tiring to experience the world as a disabled person sometimes, yes, it is troubling, and it is joyful. Sometimes the wounds and beauty we bear are glaring sometimes they are only seen when looking closely. 
<p>
Disability is what the world gives to us, disability is not rooted in the self but in culture.  And disability is not a bad word.

    <h3> Description of the first photo for the week</h3>
    <img src="'week6" alt=" The first image from February 13th is the tips of two big winter boots and the end of a cane on the bottom edge of the photo. Just above this cleared cobblestone that is grey and read peeks out from underneath a mound of snow that sits at the curb. This mound of snow arcs across the top part of the image and is largely white with clear edges." >

    <h3>Description of the second photo for the week</h3>
    <img src="'week6" alt=" The last photo was also taken on February 13th.  This photo is a photo of the lightest dusting of snow on a sidewalk, in the bottom right corner of the photo there is a round imprint in the snow from the end of a cane. It looks a bit like a period at the end of a sentence. " >
