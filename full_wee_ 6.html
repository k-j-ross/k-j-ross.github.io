<h1> <center>  Week 6 | February 12th to 18th</center></h1>
<p>
As I arrive at the end of my exploration I am beginning to walk unaided indoors. This has left me pondering the boundaries and borders we place on (dis)abledness. 
<br>
The yarns I used to sense the changes in weather have done what I expected. The yarn faded from the sunlight for the red beet treatment. For the blueberry yarn it changed spottily into shades of blue and blue green from water and alkaline exposure, and slowly faded with the sun. With the turmeric treated yarn there has been some patchy browning indicative of alkali exposure.
<br>
Changes sometimes need attention. The yarns in this project changed, and when woven into fabric that change is almost imperceptible. Things seem consistent when separate parts are woven together, but change is glaring when seen as a singular. Perhaps transformation can be most noticeable when the whole is deconstructed. Perhaps the truth is most accessible when we view the whole. I have learned the value of attending to noticing. I have learned the value of attending to noticing what I chose to notice.
<br>

It is troubling and exhilarating to experience the world as a disabled person. It is, like all life, living.
<br>
The land changes, the background fades, the picture comes into focus. My words create shapes around my ideas, time moves. I think on sharing this work with increasing perplexity.
<br>
It is tiring to experience the world as a disabled person sometimes, yes, it is troubling, and it is joyful. Sometimes the wounds and beauty we bear are glaring sometimes they are only seen when looking closely. 
<br>
Disability is what the world gives to us, disability is not rooted in the self but in culture.  And disability is not a bad word.
