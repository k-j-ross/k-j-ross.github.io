        <h1>That <a href="AboutTheBike.html"> Bike</a> From the Future</h1>
        <h3>A story by Karly Ross</h3>
        <h2>Land Back &#8212; 2084</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            Lichen was up early. Today they would head out and do some sensing, maybe see some winter fauna, but most importantly they would visit their friend Lill. Lill worked at one of the few places where natural gas and oil extraction were still permitted. Not just in BC, not just in Canada, but globally. Today would be a good day, a deep midwinter visit and time off-line. 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen thought about what to wear. Based on the forecast from yesterday they knew it would be a cold but beautiful day. It was hard to see their being much chance of anything going wrong if they followed protocol around their own movements and data collection in Dane-zaa territory. 
            </p><p>
            
            Still, a slight worry niggled in their mind. There had been tension recently between one of their collaborations as the learning center, Bill, and the joint nations data cooperative the Dane-zaa were part of. This was largely related to restrictions on data collection for scientific purposes.  It had eaten into far too much of Lichens time of late. Everyone in the spirt of truth and reconciliation would gather and try to slowly unfold a good path forward.  But Bill had been raised in a house that was staunchly opposed to the land back movement in the past. He tried, but he still framed it as loss. But it was important Lichen knew to move through the tension given the harm of the colonial past. Returning all ‘crown’ land to indigenous people and rightly recognizing all sovereignty over data collection and use had been a core pringle of the 2030 agreement. It was a core component of working together to make a livable present and future of all people. Lichen often had to face their own discomfort; they too were of a colonizing family. But discomfort when rooted in care is a seed for growth. So, that did not mean land back was easy, or that people did not get grumpy about it.  They found Bill Westman tiresome, and frustrating. But they also knew that this frustration needed tending, but not feeding, that was part of the goal for today. To feed their spirit so they could tend to the work at hand.  Today was about getting out to see Lill at the station and maybe getting some time for collection and reflection. 
            </p><p>
            
            There were also many governance systems because of the need for collaboration with many nations. For a lot of settlers this meant living in massively cool cities and trying to rebuild good things from all the good parts of their histories. It also meant people had more freedom. Consumption was de-centered, and globally everyone had a limited budget to energy and resource use that they were credited at the start of the year. At more local levels how exchange of the credits was managed was something of an ongoing negotiation. Life affirming research like Bill’s or like Lichens got some extra resource support from unused credits, which came with its own kind of indication of prestige. 
            </p><p>
            
            AS lichen rummaged through their draws stalling on the decision of what to wear, they thought about history. Lichen had achieved the highest level of skill proficiency ranking one could obtain. They now called this being a Skilled one or SO for short. They used to call it having a PhD. They chuckled, from what they read it was the same damn system. The instance of making things more even and seem more equal lead to a fair amount of euphemism around how power was organized in the local regions’ cities. It was not uncommon for people to joke that “yeas, I am a skilled or learned one, I am your humble servant, now go get me some tea.” Covert forms of power were still pervasive amongst people who felt their path should earn them respect. One would not claim this was healthy, but then, what big system of people ever was? 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen thought more about this as they pulled on their pants. They had chosen the temperature and muscle sensing pants for the ride. They were a particular favorite of lichens, and they had worked with a team in a local makers space to make these pants and all their fluoresceable and sensing clothing. 
            </p><p>
            
            They were an expert in the scientific methods of bio-habitat restoration, particularly around native plants and soils. Their work focused on restoration aspects of landscape engineering. Expert was an odd word, Lichen seldom felt like an expert, and with 30-hour work weeks, developing expertise took time. They worked at the norther learning center satellite.  An intuition that went back before the reckoning and was once called the university of Northern British Columbia.
            </p><p>
            
            
            Their other love, in their spare time, was making things like their clothing. Or hacking things, like their bike. This was not viewed as a bad thing, but it was also considered a sort of oddity or clinging to the past world of material accumulation. Lichen pondered how this had been a sore spot between them and their ex. Their obsession with sensing both body and world through self-created bodywear had not landed well. For Lichen the fascination with how we understand the world though such things ran deep, but to Sam it had been confounding and off-putting, for all the typical reasons. 
            </p><p>
            
            So, Lichen enjoyed making beautiful things that also showed them things. This idea of a bike as sensor had kind of changed their experience of life. It made it even more fun that it could change color, sense the world around them, show them things through the fabric displays, and help them communicate well when riding through the bustling streets of the city on their bicycle. The use of computing for the complex sensing networks they and others on their teams, had created did impact their energy and matter use quotas at firs.  But now they had generated systems where much of their clothing and mobility devices were self-sustaining in relation to power, and they also at times generated extra energy. This was particularly true in the summer, when the materials they used would gather more energy than they needed from the sun. This also helped to support the material needs of their research. So, Lichen loved thinking about these things and how they could help them collect and understand the scientific data they gathered about the state of eco-restoration in the FSJ region. 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen slowly pulled on their warm winter riding shirt with forearm displays that would show up on command and only showed then what they wanted to see. They grabbed their watch and put it on. The shirt fluoresced as it linked with the watch. They descended the stares from the attic in house they shared with their mother Florance, and others. Lichen and Florance had moved here to escape the grief of their loss in Madrid after they lost Lichens dad and brother to the last plague. They were 12 at the time. Walking into the kitchen they reflected on how they and their father had gotten into to end of debate over gender. It was not that he was not supportive, or that he was not a good man. He was both. But he still talked like someone from the 20’s open but stuck in binary thinking in how he phrased things. A lump rose in lichens throat, grief, sadness. Now that they were older, they understood better and thought back with love about his constant admonition of loving all parts of them. 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichens mom was up and sitting at the table. No. one else in their quite little 12-person household was even stirring yet. She looked up at lichen as they walked in starting the morning by saying “I wish you would think about the risk you are taking today. When you go out on long adventures in the cold, thin about what could happen, you are after all a human being not a muskox” 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen sighed and rolled their eyes. This was an all-too-common refrain, and still Florance seemed not to grasp that the wood-buffalo in the region were not muskox. Large fauna identification had never been a strong suit for Florance, she at least had the ungulate nature of the beasts correct. As with her data work in the committee around data practices and working with the Dane-zee she knew engaging this with grumpiness would not create the world she wanted. 
            </p><p>
            “I know you feel this way mom, and I want to honor that you feel that. I also must maintain my relationship with myself, and this is super important to me. I have a beacon, and I have generally good relations in this territory. Who knows maybe it will prompt some new data collection or sharing stuff…” Lichen trailed off, that was a pipe dream. “Anyways,” lichen said drawing the word out, “I have not seen Lill in an age and I owe her a visit”  
            </p><p>
            
            Lichens mom closed her book on her lap, its pages slowing closing together shutting it off, she took a long look at lichen and a long sip of chicory coffee with local honey and oat foam. Lichen was always amused by this, it was not an overly good drink, the coffee bean coffee grown in the local greenhouses was so much more nuanced in flavor, but after the reckoning, this had been her mother’s drink of choice, and she had stuck with it. 
            </p><p>
            “I know” Florance said, “I am also allowed to worry…40 km of riding in a data transfer blackout zone is not something many folks do but I also know that is because there are not many people with a good reason to”
            </p><p>
            
            “I will be sure to wear my eau d’ours. Or maybe eau du wood-buffalo, I have always wanted to race one on my bike!” Lichen teased, knowing her mom knew they had olfactory blockers that changed her scent when her bike or her clothing sensed a big animal that their presence could disturb. Combined with the color morph they had once called this neo-camouflage. This upset Florance who explained the social connotations and ideas people had about camouflage when she was a child. But Florance always being didactic, had been quick to point out, perception and reality, then as now, always were vastly different. 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen had yet to figure out what to call this sensor responsive technique of blending into the landscape that had become here teams’ big accomplishments in relation to being able to assess restoration progress and infrastructure impacts with minimal impact. They would name it someday.
            </p><p>
            
            Lichens mom knew them well enough not to be alarmed by tinier bad humour, but she rolled her still eyes while she laughed and then said, “I may be at the centre this evening when you get home, I have an idea I have been working on with people there.”  While she was saying this Lichen pulled on their winter helmet, their under-mitts, and their winter riding boots, all products of their maker team,
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen stepped outside. 20 degrees below. Shit, it was colder than expected. That had been happening more and more frequently of late as the mitigation efforts of the world in the 30’s and 40’s started to bear out, it may not be long before this place was <em>too</em>. cold again, that would be a beautiful thing. It also meant most people would just stay in today. Some would contribute to the community from home, others would take the cold as a signal to rest. The plowers would have been out several times since the snow, so all paths, sidewalks and roads would be clear. Clear but not empty.  
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen looked up, there was no moon today, and the sky was clear, they breathed in the biting air as they pulled their jackets color up to cover their face. The stars, the night sky, the cold of midwinter. Home.
            </p><p>
            
            A few steps and they were at the bike shelter.  Slowly pulling their bike out and turning it on they connected it to their wristwatch which connected its eco-sensing data to the city network and the centers data banks. They would be riding and tracking and stopping in all communal lands to record any plant or animal that had yet to be noticed, and to test the new technique they had to identify local native plants in the winter through visual sensing worked. 
            </p><p>
            
            They slipped their hands into the pogies, which lit up with two soft glowing displays, asking them what they wanted to track today. For biometrics they gave the voice command for breathing and lung temperature. Cold could do damage and Lichen was prone to pushing too hard, they liked the feel of being strong. They also asked for a warning if feet hands or other appendages got too cold, and for all other biometrics to be kept off for the day. Their bike then asked them if they wanted distance elevation and pedal count, and they said, “hmm, no not today, but thanks for asking.” IT was usual for them to record things, but some adventures were more fun if the tools were less omnipresent. The relevant screen on their right pogie when dark, it would only signal with a small glow and some text if there were issues with breathing or temperature.
            </p><p>
            
            Then they gave the voice command to sense all creatures of interest for the whole bike ride, and to keep a soft glowing display of notable ones present on the left pogie. With a slight twitch of their left hand over the handlebar, the bike gave a left signal, and they pulled out of the driveway. 
            </p><p>
            
            The street was quiet enough that Lichen did not need a lot of light, but as they rode down the street, Petra who used a wheelchair could be heard pulling out in her pod.  Lichens bike sensing this provided all the display needed for Petras pod to sense them as well, and for Petra to see them. Petra passed them in the automated vehicle at about 35 km an hour. ‘Must be her turn to run the winter garden this month’ Lichen thought. Petra was one of the city’s top gardeners and had been an expert in local food production her whole life. She was also one of the head gardeners at the learning centers garden, one of the most prestigious jobs in the city.  The dim lights from the city’s gardens could be seen to be slowing turning on. After the reckoning food production, even this far north, was all required to be done locally. That meant the entire city of FSJ once Fort Saint John now called in jest Forest of Several Justifications, grew all the food needed to feed its residents.  
            </p><p>
            
            AS lichen road to the center, they thought, ‘hey I should see if Sal is around.’ Lichen was hoping to touch base with Sal a friend of theirs who was a Dane-zaa   and a “learned” one and sat on the committee trying to figure this data thing out. A quick chat would give insight on who they may run into today and what proper protocol would be. Sure, it was usually not an issue, but winter travel in Dane-zaa territory by people who were not Dane-zaa was uncommon, not forbidden, just not usually done. 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen took a right turn on the next path and was suddenly given a strong slow down signal on their left pogie with a small quit ding transfers to their ear thorough their helmet, and a buzz signal in the handlebars. A pedestrian was ahead in dark clothing! Lichen slowed, and singled and rang a bell, and gave a light signal, and then passed the pedestrian and carried on. 
            </p><p>
            
            Arriving at the learning center, they pulled their bike up to the heated shelter, at the entrance to their building, noticed Petra wheeling into the garden that was just next door, and waved. Petra waved back, Lichen felt a pang of guilt, they owed Petra a drink and had done for over six months. 
            </p><p>
            
             They walked into their building, and it was quit, there was a hum of noise and a few signals in her office that indicated who would be in, and who was away. Ah, she noted, Sal’s tag read on Dane-zaa land.
            </p><p>
            
            Well, that was that. It was time to start the day and see what may come. Time for a proper bike ride. 
            </p><p>
            
            The ride out of the city proceeded much as the ride to the learning centre had. Small soft signals to help her notice when people moving more slowly than them may need some space. On the roads where solar buses ran the bike would sense them coming and provide enough light to ensure that everyone would see each other. If there was not a signal of sight, the bike would send out a ping in hopes that the other vehicles were wired in. Wired vehicles should be automated to slow down, but as most people used a mix of bikes, and walking, and bus, sometimes things got confused. Most private vehicles were kept reserved for people who could not use these other modes for whatever reason, and because everything moved slowly, usually a bit of extra pinging did the trick. Accidents did happen, but it was not looked upon very favorably by anyone if you caused injury to a person using a more venerable mode of transport. The social stigma was a significant determent, and the speed controls on all devices in the city helped reduce fatal injury to a rarity that produced massive local grief. 
            </p><p>
            
            There were not big distinctions about where people could travel other than the rail lines, which were exclusive to that mode and crisscrossed the city and country. This caused no end of debate in city meetings about how best to interface between trains and bikes and predestinations and other wheels. 
            </p><p>
            
            Reaching the edge of the city, the bike started to perk up, a soft glow on the headtube indicated to Lichen that they were in fact recording local biome-data. The soft play and morphing of light highlighting that the data collected was dynamic, on their handlebar headset a count display popped up, they had already ridden past 16 distinct species as recorded by their bike, but none on the endangered list. All this data was now being sent through satellite as they rode, the connection zone and protocol would change soon enough. 
            </p><p>
            
            This was a common enough stretch of highway that Lichen did not expect to get too much new, but suddenly their handlebars vibrated a bit, and a small forest green number appeared on the left.  
            </p><p>
            “What have you found?” Lichen asked their bike. 
            </p><p>
            “I am not sure, I am also not sure it is rare, I need your expertise to help me identify it.” The bike replied.
            </p><p>
            ” Where is it?” Lichen asked.
            </p><p>
             “I will direct you to where I noticed it” the bike said in its genital baritone.
            </p><p>
             Lichen slowly turned around and for the next five minutes the bike laid out directional arrows on the ground and on the pogies which Lichen followed. Then the stop symbol appeared, and lichen stopped.
            </p><p>
             “Ok, where?” Lichen asked, 
            </p><p>
            “You will need to get off the bike and take about 15 steps to the north” the bike said, 
            </p><p>
            Lichen did as they were told, “other north” the bike called after them. Lichen turned 180 and kept waking. “It should be there,” the bike said, lichen took a long deep breath and looked down, it was hard to tell from the winter stem but…
            </p><p>
             “Rubus Ideaus?!” Lichen exclaimed, “Raspberries!” a member of the rose family which had been sparce to non-existent for years following a massive ten-year period of fire blight that had decimated plants of the rose family across the western part of north America. “Rare enough, if that is what it is!”
            Lichen strode back to their bike and got out their field tablet and returned to the precious plant. Recording all saliant details, time located, taking a picture, size apparent condition, location.
            </p><p>
            
            “Are we still in the open data zone,” Lichen probed not wanting to upload anything yet, but making sure they were not crossing a boundary here. 
            </p><p>
            
            “We are for about 1 more kilometre” the bike said.
            </p><p>
            
            “Cool, that is really exciting!”
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen finished making their field note and then sat there, in awe. After a while the bike said, “your feet are becoming cold, may I suggest we get moving again?” 
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen laughed, got up, put away the field tablet and got back on their bike. All remained calm, with a slight adjustment to the soft patterned symbol on their left pogie indicating that all data was now being transmitted to the Dane-zaa networked and jammed from being shared with the Northwestern American Global Network NWANG.
            </p><p>
            
            On they rode, a few kilometers later they turned onto the gravel road that would take them to the wellsite. Just 10 more km. The light was starting to soften, and nautical dawn was dawning. They took in the deep slate blue sky, and the many species of conifers around them. There was a time where this world existing was hard to imagine, so much effort, so much change, this was amazing. 
            </p><p>
            
            Suddenly, about 5 km from the site, their bike lurched forward, and they came to a sudden stop as a big broken branch came barreling at them.
            </p><p>
            
            They tumbled off the bike walking forward in shock, assessing their surroundings. Their bikes front wheel was bent and would need some proper repair equipment, they would need to walk the rest of the way, but where did that come from. 
            </p><p>
            
            They heard the brush rustling, and then a group of chidden came running out, taunting echoer about who could throw the biggest log, followed by, “SAL!”
            </p><p>
            
            “Hi Sal!” Lichen said, and Sal laughed, as the kids looked up at them with a bit of concern, “I have been told throwing logs is all the rage these days,” Lichen said, “I just did not expect one to be thrown at me.” Sal, laughed, “everything ok?” “I’m fine” Lichen said, but my bike will need some work. “Funny though, I had wanted to ask you at the center how to make sure I traveled to the site using protocol, and was told you were out of contact, it seems I may be interrupting something, I am sorry.” 
            </p><p>
            
            “Not at all” said Sal, “it is just kids playing, though a reasonably short stop would be preferred, I am trying to give myself space from the committee right now, you know, get myself grounded again, I have been struggling to show up and be the person I want to be in repones to Bill lately, and his instance on full data sharing is so absolutist, there is a reason we are protective, we and every other Nation, Bill seems happy to forget history.” 
            </p><p>
            
            “I know, oh by the way, my bike and I IDed what we think is a wild raspberry on the open part of the highway, we have long been wondering about it as an indicator of restoration, so this is kind of cool, I have not uploaded it yet, I know this will add fuel to Bills fire if he thinks there is restoration of species spread that we cannot track because of the data jammers. Because of that I think that I should wait and send it your way until your data scientists make their determination of what data is appropriate to share. 
            </p><p>
            
            
            Sal chuckled, and rolled her eyes, “thanks Lichen, but really you do not have to overdo it, go ahead and load it when you are open data sharing space. I think it may remind all of us about what we share in this, a desire to center the rebuilding of a broken world, But I will l will let our data team know. They should have a response of next steps from our side for you tonight.”
            </p><p>
            
            “You heading to see Lill?” Sal changed the topic. 
            </p><p>
            
            ‘whoops” though Lichen ‘that was a bit of a boundary push from me’. 
            “Yeh, it’s been a while.” Lichen said out loud. 
            </p><p>
            
            “You good for the walk?”
            </p><p>
            
            “Yeh I am fine.”
            </p><p>
            
            Lichen walked onward, and the sun was well over the horizon by the time they arrived at the site. Lill came up and gave them a huge hug, raising briefly from her wheelchair so it could be a full-bodied embrace, before settling back down into it again.
            </p><p>
            
            “So, you come bearing a broken bike and what exactly?” Lill queried.
            </p><p>
            
            “Time for a visit?”
            </p><p>
            
            “Ah the most beautiful gift of all!”
            </p><p>
            
            They walked and wheeled over to the workshop and asked Roy if he would fix lichens bike and then wandered over to grab a meal from the canteen, and then up onto a ridge to visit. 
            </p><p>
            
            The view as always was spectacular.

            “How are you Lichen, I mean really?” probed
            </p><p>
            
            “I am weary” Lichen said, “I have been working on this committee, and it feels like we will never arrive at an agreement for knowledge sharing that will respect everyone’s needs. We have been at it for a few years now, I was still in training when it started.  I mean I think there is progress, but I guess I am just really starting to see how people like Bill still hold onto things that I wish we could have let go of during the reckoning.  If I have to hear him complain about how Indigenous data control is slowing down progress towards understating restoration one more time, I swear I am not sure I can hold myself back from snapping at him. The point is not that its better, but that to have truly equitable exchange, we need to decenter how science in a singular sense has been, was, maybe still is? practiced. See I ran into Sal today, and she told me it is fine, and they have it in hand. But this really feels like I need to trust the process, trust that we can come to a way of agreeing about and valuing what different people value and think is important to share from their perspective of cultural control. The council of global Chiefs has repeatedly reminded the descendants of the colonizers that this is about a process that will restore balance. We had the chance to measure everything and claim it was for life, we did not do it, so taking guidance on what we should measure based on what a plurality of land based cultures thinks is important is the thing we are trying, it is not the end, it is the process and Bill is just grump that he does not get his perfect data in a form he can control. But seriously, who has ever had perfect data?” Lichen dumped all of this without paying much attention to the cohesion of the ideas.

            They want on” I mean, I saw a raspberry cane today! A wild raspberry cane! Our data did not do that, there are 5 blackout zones between us and the nearest previously indicated wild raspberry plant, our open global data did not do that, and maybe that is the point….Lill my grandma always used to tell my mom that ‘one word for hope was bicycle ‘I live my life through and on my bike, I love my work in theory, and I will not be free until everyone is free, including all the living beings we chose to let perish and die for our greed before the reckoning. And yes, including Bill!”
            </p><p>
            
            Looking out at the clear blue winter sky Lill said “hope is the refusal to let evil ideas flourish, hope is our connection to world, hope is knowing that somewhere there are so many people doing the work to fix this dying world, for life and equality, and for repair not for control. Most days though, hope is a sapling coming up in ground that was dying, and a bird in spring sitting on its branch, and a moment of understanding shared by people”

            Lichen hugged Lill after retrieving their bike from the repair shop. 
            The ride back to the city that night was (Almost) entirely uneventful, everything was working just as designed, 10 km out of town, just after a train had passed the alarms for approaching large mammal went off, signaling to the system that all was well, and blending Lichen into the forest while blocking their scent to the surroundings. A massive moose with two younger ones ambled over the road not 4 meters in front of Lichen. They watched in awe and wonder, with a heart filling with a sense of connection to this land.

            Upon entering the open data zone their net link notifications signaled on their pogies. They stopped and looked at their field tablet and uploaded the data collected earlier that day. The tablet ponged. Bill, Sal, the joint nations data cooperative (JNDC). The JNDC which had data sovereignty over land-based data fir their regional territories had made a new data set public. “Population density of Rubis species across the data closed zones over the last 50 years,” It was showing care, attention and work that was finally leading to the restoration of the many species in the family more broadly. Specific locations would remain masked for now to the protect the plants, but the general population density was open now for all to see. This would be top news across the world tomorrow, such successes of restoration were becoming increasingly common. Bill was still grumpy, “why can we not have the full data set” he grumbled in a long a message to Lichen.
            </p><p>
            
            To which lichen responded, “look at the success, I think focusing on how we can work together to do more of that is a good thing, it is no longer our choice how we communicate this microlevel information, we have all control over satellite data, this kind of regrowth, this is not something our science has ever been overly good at, why do you find that so damn hard to accept. Our world is repairing, yes there are imbalances in information, that is about reestablishing equilibrium, we go over and over and over this. What is it you need to hear from me to feel like I hear you. I am at a loss Bill!”

            When they arrived home that evening, they slowly took their clothing off and held their mother close. Florance admonished them that Petra the gardener had been asking after them, and that they should really go over for a drink.
            </p><p>
            
            Then, they grabbed a bottle of local apple cider, walked on over to Petras, poured them both a drink and told Petra everything about their day. Petra sat for a long time, you know, I thank our ancestors every day, not that thy left us with a world where we need such restrictive energy credits or where to restore a balance, we must be so assertive about how we access information, but because despite all of that, they chose to find a way for us to live. What a time for us to be alive! May we carry our time well for those who follow.”

            The night was cold, the starts were bright, and things were as they often are, good, good but messy!
