        Madrid | 2030
        <p>
        The radio blared in the background as Jenn holds Florance while looking out at the hot smog laden streets of Madrid. Florance is usually a squirmy baby but today she, like her mother, is passive from heat. 
        
        </p><p>
        “Today marks the first day of the global futures summit, hosted in Singapore” the radio hums from Jenn’s phone, “This is true Dev,” the commentator interrupts,” after the last five years it seems the world is ready to come together and try to find a path forward don’t you think?” A pause. “This summit,” the announcer states “is the product of countless hours of effort by people globally associated with the ‘loose gathering’ a movement to ensure a good present and future through many paths” “what do you think got us here Dev?” The color commentary interrupts.
        </p><p>
        
        The announcer drones on regularly interrupted by the far to chipper color commentator. Jenn checks out, news in podcast form had gotten very irritating over the past several years. Oh well. It would be more of the same, chose what to blame today, authoritarianism, capitalism, technology, work dislocation due to AI, carbon extraction, colonialism, greed, misogyny, religion. Every day it was the same conversations, just the reason change. Jenn was, though part of the ‘loose gathering’, wearied by this. She struggled to believe that there could or would be any change possible, and she knew that struggle was counterproductive. After the last five years, the massive losses of information, of forests, the dropping of nuclear in 2028 around the world, impacting, practically every nuclear state, the increased use of fossil fuels, the full out attacks on queer folks and migrants that had hit Leta’s family so profoundly.  She clung to hope but struggled to do so while absorbing the inane chatter. Turning the radio off she thinks whatever happens I will find out soon enough.

        She moves towards a chair. It would be easy to think things were OK if you did not pay attention, she thought. She shakes her head and sits down as Florance fusses and asked to be fed. While feeding her she says to her infant child, “there are really only a set of rather simple questions to ask. One,” she whispered, “what do we need to imagine about the earth and each other to flourish together, all living beings on the plant. two what do I need to do today for you, to make sure you can live well and that my grandchildren can live well? “Rocking Florance, she nods of holding her sleeping child in her arms.

        She starts, laughing at herself, the buzz whap that had made her jump was just the sound of her partner dinging her on her phone from Accra. “Are you hearing this” Leta wrote, “they have just agreed unanimously Including America that there can be no path forward that does not include the restoration of ecosystems…” Florance was now fast asleep and holding her as gently as she can Jenn stands up and walks over to the window, noticing as a cargo bike rolling by on the street below.  The cyclist is languidly pedaling but with a lot of e-assist to keep moving in the heat— the rider, despite the weather, smiling. “See that my dear” she whispers to Florance thinking about how her and Leta had met at a queer cycling congress some years ago. “See that, I promise you whatever comes, I will teach you how to ride a bike. Oh, my love, always remember one word for hope is bicycle”
