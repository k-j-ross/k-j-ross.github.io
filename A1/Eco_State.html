        <p>
            It is not even 5 in the morning and Florance’s heart is already breaking as her and Maxine get into the same old argument.
            </p><p>
            
            “They will find out someday Maxine” she says in the angriest whisper she can muster. Arguments of this type were always done in enraged whispers to keep out of the earshot of neighbours. 
            </p><p>
            
            “And then what? I will be completely without support, and you will be in the resto-camps… With all your skill, you do not need to make yourself stand out so much, do you? Just stop, she breaks down, please, just stop, I wish we had never come to Canada, my worry for you is consuming me”
            </p><p>
            
            Max shakes their head, as they slowly bind their breasts and add the bio-blocking/bio-signal-hacking “sock” so their underwear. Earth be praised for the myco-net they thought. The myco-net, named after mycelium, to distinguish its underground nature and life affirming purpose as district from the dark-web, was the largely hidden network that people could access to obtain things to help them survive in a world that thought they did not exist. The bio-sock was commonly used by folks who needed to biologically pass as male but had biochemistry that did not send the right signals of masculinity according to the eco-state and their surveillance devices. What it did not fake was breath rate and heart rate, which was part of how it remained undetected, Max was not enterally sure of the why of this. Hip circumference, T levels, even vocal pitch all faked, heart rate, breath rate, these Max had to manage themself. 
            </p><p>
            
            “Call me Max mom” They whispered back in the same intensity of anger. “I know it upsets you…” They say, feeling the routineness of this conversation wearing on them. “It is the world that fasces on strict assumptions of biological role and correctness to maintain ecological balance. That’s fucked.” They paused to regroup as they saw their mom tense with the last statement. Softening they said “We have been over this just call me Max at all times and you are less likely to slip up and out me”
            </p><p>
            
            They both stood in the persistent grief of this moment. What could Max have done differently with their dad gone. It was easy once they set things in motion to move to Canada, Afterall Max’s dad had been a Canadian Citizen, and Florance had been awarded citizenship upon marriage. Faking documenters so Max would appear male on paper was far easier if one moved. Once moved the transition had to be permanent. So, they had moved to Canada, and to Fort Saint John when Max was 12. They had been having the same argument for 18 years. Max had lived with their mom that whole time, other than stints in Prince George to get their master’s and PhD. Now that Max had access to many high security resto-sites, and that their security clearance kept increasing, Florance had been pushing for them to aim lower. More access meant more surveillance, more chance of exposure, more risk of catastrophe. 
            </p><p>
            
            Max’s dad and brother had died in the last major plague, when max was 11. Their dad had been such an amazing human, committed to making things fair for all people, he had actively sought to continue to educate Florance, taking over from her mothers. Florance had been forced to leave school in elementary. because of the enforcement of gender roles, but Max’s dad had never held that against her. 
            </p><p>
            
            Max struggled on, trying to get clarity, and understanding. They breathed in and calmly stated “You know I do not do this because I want to hurt you mom, you know I love my work as bioengineer, the restoration is literally the only really good thing to come out of this system. I love my work; I hate the system. I cannot live a full life if I am fully myself. How I live is deeply rooted in traditions of survival, and I do think this too shall pass. I hear Bill next door playing those old songs that are none the less subversive, all the old British shit…” Florance’s stiffened at the word shit and Max rephrased “all that old British isle music he listens to that the state claims are ‘part of our history’ is damn subversive if you listen close.” Max thought about how the neo-nostalgic bunch amused them, as their mom looked on with the same sad loving look that they gave Max on every site visit day. 
            </p><p>
            
            They were now back beside their bed as their mom looked on, unfolding their cloths from their dresser, pulling on their bio-shirt, its sleeves near their hands would slowly change color through the day based on the amount of exercise they had gotten and how much food and water they had consumed and how much fatigue had been sensed. Also, it would continuously support their watch in pinging geolocation to support information from the proximity sensors in keeping Max safe. Small dots would accumulate up the outside of the arms to indicate total water drank and total exercise achieved. The soft fabric pulsed once around the writs and fluoresced indicating it had linked up with Max’s watch to help coordinate pulse rate, blood pressure and food intake and so much more. The shirt would sense both micro and macro arm movements and the general movement and vibrations in the torso to help achieve a measurement of a wide range of metrics. 
            </p><p>
            
            Fo something so high tech It was terribly inaccurate. Max never knew if that was because of the bio-sock or just that the system of measurements of people was crap. Max was not allowed to travel for work without it. They pulled on their pants which were meant to monitor muscular contractions, and temperature. This would be used with the link up to handlebar display to prompt increased or decreased activity levels while riding. Next were their riding boots a thick waterproofed wool felt that was covered with sensors barely perceptible to the eye. Cold feet during winter rides could cause serious issues, their boots would also monitor their feet for risk of frostbite. Finally, was the heavily waterproofed and their winter riding jacket which was made of entirely fluoresceable fabric that would light up to different colors in each region depending on the bio-chemical signal that the embedded bio-thread transmitted through it. It looked like a basic boiled wool jacket, but had displays worked into its fabric throughout, it could change colors, send signals, or show data. And Like Maxes bike the jacket had both proximity and camera sensors. Max’s bike was likewise fluoresceable. Next was their lined winter riding helmet, it had a Max’s bike was likewise fluoresceable. display on the back, that was connected to the signal sensors on the handlebars of the bike, as was the jacket.
            </p><p>
            
            Walking out the door while taking a swig of water they prepared to face the day.   
            </p><p>
            
            Now every part of their movement, their body, and their speech would be monitored. The eco- states all varied in how much surveillance they chose to employ. In Canada, the choice had been to protect the privacy of heads of households by keeping the state out of the home. This was intended to stop prosecutions on domestic violence but had the benefit of allowing Max to be themselves at home and be a man in public. It was also nice to function in a legal system where no data collected in the home was permissible as evidence in a court, no matter what that evidence was. It was a weird system. Madrid in contrast had gone more permissive but more pervasive in its surveillance. Less full-blown recording, Men were allowed to teach family members things and were held accountable for domestic violence, and in home monitoring through devices was the norm. There was no perfect system. 
            </p><p>
            
            Max looked up, there was no moon today, and the sky was clear, they breathed in the biting air as they pulled their jackets color up to cover their face. The stars, the night sky, the cold of midwinter. Home. A quick moment passed in wonder before Max walked over to the bike garage where their bike and all its components had been recharging from the solar bank over the last 9 hours. The silly garage was almost as big as their ‘home’ a, testament to how the bicycle was now viewed as an object of status and privilege. Home was 500 square foot room with a single bathroom in a row of rooms in a building that all faced this outdoors and the year spaces. Indoor space was one of the things the eco-state limited to curb extraneous consumption. 
            </p><p>
            
            They tapped their watch to the headset which linked the bike to the net and unlocked it. I also linked the bike to the sensors in their shirt, on their watch and in their pants to the bike sensors and to the display on the pogies. Based on the physical fitness data collected the pogie displays would provide them guidance on the best level of activity to have, and how that mirrored past levels. All this data would be uploaded to the companies and government data bases on the top technocrats’ levels of personal achievement. Useful information like the quality of restoration work or changes in vegetation, which could be done with the technology, were not considered a useful way to use energy. Beter to optimize the human than notice the world. 
            </p><p>
            
            The privilege of having a good education and a prestigious job is that they were permitted to ride a bike, and that because of that privilege they were also monitored so that other people could use the data as something to aspire to. Furthermore, their success made them the perfect specimen to support biomedical research on general health, fitness and mobilities of mitigation. While everyone had to always wear proximity sensors, and all out of home speech was recorded, as was the context of the individual through the basic writ watch, most people did not experience this level of surveillance.   
            </p><p>
            
            The air was cool, a good fifteen below Celsius, not as cold has it could get, but not atypical for Fort Saint John. Max mounted their bike and rode off, the snow plowed bikeways were filled with other upper-level technocrats like them. All on bikes like theirs. Traveling to work by bike. 
            </p><p>
            
            Everyone was guided and directed by little arrows that landed on the ground in front of them, or on their pogie displays. For the upper level of massive network of where people were, and where they were headed was used to define the most efficient and healthful route to work each day. Max noticed the pace targets for the day on the soft fabric of the right pogie. Pace targets were meant to ensure they got the optimal cardio workout based on body temperature, air temperatures, and many other things. 
            </p><p>
            
            The bike suggested that they should take a left. They ran their hand across the handlebar, in the left direction. This singled to their integrated bike and clothing system to signal a left-hand turn. They noticed as they did this that their bike was giving them less power support than usual, meaning the system decided Max needed a bit of extra cardio despite the cold. The annoying red dot appeared bedside the target, meaning, well that they were missing it. They sped up and the light blinked off. 
            </p><p>
            
            Next their bike prompted them to take a right into the upcoming shared street, they gave their right handlebar a swipe and made the turn. AS they did so, all the cars and busses in the street were stopped by proximity sensor alerts as they passed by. Vision zero they called it. No death to the elite cyclists. As they road past the now stopped buses they wondered internally what happened to all the people who did not have the privilege of cycling.  Were they late to work on days when to many people needed to bike on the streets with them? This thought prompted max to pedal harder. But their bike sounded an alarm, and the handlebars started buzzing. The bikes stated in an overly sexualized woman’s voice, ‘you are moving too fast for temperatures Max, please slow down”.  
            </p><p>
            
            The rest of the ride to the office proceeded in this way and they arrived in good time just before 0600. They went inside and did the paperwork needed to head to the site for the day. At 7 am, still in darkness, they head back to their bike, unlocked it with a tap of their watch, and headed out of town.  
            </p><p>
            
            While cities had enough proximity sensing and a good enough supplemental geolocation grid to keep cyclists safe when they shared the roads with other vehicles, out of town did not. This had led the state to ban all automated, what they used to call vehicles, on the highways. The only non-e-bike motor allowed on the highways was the snowplough and it went out during times that it was forbidden to ride. Highways paved, gravel, or otherwise were for active transit only. Other self-propelled were speed limited at 35 km/h. In the summer there were usually lots of walkers, but less so in the winter. That meant today, being a cyclist with no limit to speed, Max would likely be one of the fastest people on the highway.  Even so, it would still take them an hour, maybe two to get to the site.
            </p><p>
            
            They stepped onto their bike while thinking about how they were a bit worried about the visit today. It was a new site with high clearance which max guessed meant it was a resto-camp. Noone ever said it, but it was widely assumed that resto-camps were in fact oil and gas sites that had been kept open to meet the needs of the pharmaceuticals and other select companies that had not been able to find alternatives to fossil fuel-based carbon yet. They specialized in monitoring native plant distribution and soil repair on decades old sites, so they were not sure why they had been assigned this job. 
            </p><p>
            
            This sense of unease was not softened by their boss explaining to them that morning that “Due to the need for strict protection, all human movement was fully monitored in and out of the site.” He had gone on to explain that “Once you turn onto the gravel road Max, the site will know exactly where you are and what you are doing at all times. It is a much crisper net even that what we have in the city. What this means is that if you must piss in the bush, do it before you make that turn, otherwise you will set off a flag in the system.”
            </p><p>
            
            Max noted the advice, they never pissed in front of anyone, but this would be a hard day. ‘I should have got a catheter from the myco-net’ they thought to themselves as they pulled away from the office. Too late now…
            </p><p>
            
            Once on the road Max tried to avoid watching the monitors on the pogies. There was no of switch. The only people who could turn them off were his bosses. But Max had always felt that the displays created visual clutter in the landscape when they were riding on the highway. 
            </p><p>
            
            Clearing the edge of the city Max’s entire body relaxed. There was nothing quite like riding into the tunnel of rehabilitee forests. The morning train south of the road passed by with some speed, clearly it had kept a good charge and was able to power itself through the night. They road on, passing a few scooters, and a pedestrian. And then it was just them and the highway. Bliss. “A word for hope is bike” they would think to themselves at these times.
            </p><p>
            
            In the city the sensors on the bike were focused on other people, out here, they focused on other movement from non-human nature. About 20 km into the ride Max heard a rustling and then their bike blared and honked and their pogies, jacket, and bike, sent flaring colors out and even shone flashing light onto the road.  They could not be more other from the forest if they tried. Here in the calm light of nautical dawn they were a florescent strobe light on an old highway in one of the capitals of eco-rehab commerce. Movement in this place was sparce, and here they were displaying like some kind of angry light bulb. It was not the best part of the job.
            </p><p>
            
            On they rode as the blazing absurdity died down. They liked to imagine they could hear animal running away, but they were pretty sure the only thing any creature with hearing could hear was the echo of their bike’s tantrum. Max felt a pang of regret. They had never seen a wild greater larger than a mouse or chipmunk. No bear, no dear, the bike would always sense movement proximate, and once out of an urban net, would head into full tantrum mode. Max very much felt like a wild animal in these moments, the experience, when it happened always shot their nervous system to bits. It would take them a good fifteen minutes to regroup. 
            </p><p>
            
            They were moving a bit slow today, but that was by instruction. The cold air could damage lungs, and they had low battery charge and so were in rechaining mode; 30km/h.  At around 0810, as the dawn was become closer today, they turned the corner for the last 15 km of the ride. It was like roads they told you about in engineering classes: old, gravel, marked with holes -- this would take a bit longer than expected.  
            </p><p>
            
            The ride passed in serine quiet, and then about 10 km down the road their bike started having a fit again. Blazing horns, angry handlebars, flashing. ‘Good thing I am not epidictic’ Max thought. The tantrum died down and then suddenly a group of people was swarming towards them, running straight at them out of the woods. Where did they come from? Max wondered?” His heart rate had spiked, and he had started to sweat more than was safe for this time of the year. One person ran forward and jammed a bar in the spokes of the bike, and Max felt themselves flying of. Then, as quickly as it started, the people were gone, but the carnage was not. 
            </p><p>
            
            Hobbling back to the bike with a full deployment of crash helmet. Max surveyed the damage. The computers were still working, but they were angry, their access to the net had been stopped for the attack. Huh, Max thought, that is weird. But the bike? The bike would need a new front wheel. The only way was to continue to the camp. 
            </p><p>
            
            45 minutes later, with many upset signals forming from their sensors, they staggered up to the gate and presented their card and hand for scanning to the security agent. “My apologies for being late, I was attacked about 5 km out and my bike is now busted. Because we are in the security satellite comms blackout zone, I could not call for road assets to come and repair it for me.” The security guard nodded, “you’re not the first, head on in, I will get one of the workers to help you get cleaned up, she is a sweet little thing, it will be no trouble. In the meantime, I will get our mechanic to fix your bike so you can still get home today, top priority.”
            </p><p>
            
            Max quickly confirmed to themself that this was not just a site, it was a camp. They noticed that there were people from all over and of all genders working there. It was an active well also, ‘so yes this is where they get the oil for the virgin plastics and pharmaceuticals they thought.’ The woman Sophia who came to help him, smirked. 
            </p><p>
            
            “Hello, Max, is it?”
            </p><p>
            
            “That’s right, Max said”
            </p><p>
            
            “Let me help you to the facilities”
            </p><p>
            
            “I would much rather just get on with my work if that is, ok?”
            </p><p>
            
            Once they were out of earshot of the Forman and security guard, Sophia gave him a long hard look up and down and said “I know what you are, you are not unlike us, but unlike us you have found a way to hide from them. You are safe here, but you are also needed, we have implants that helps us filter out myco-net devices to help see each other. Maybe something you should try? Thing is but they only work in a network. Had we known before the attack, we would have tried a different approach.”
            </p><p>
            
            The voice of Max’s mom started ringing in their ears “If they find out they will send you to the camps” and what was that Sophia just said, “Had we known before the attack” 
            </p><p>
            The woman whispered, while holding down an implant in her hand that seemed to dampen all singles, “this is what we will do, we will get you cleaned up and get you home, we need you safe, and we need you free”
            </p><p>
            
            Later that day after a long private conversation in a private room “for the discretion of Max to do as he liked:” with the woman Sophia and who was an old-world lesbian, Sophia and max sat on an old log looking at the sky while they waited for Maxes bike to be fixed.
            </p><p>
            
            Max said as Sophia pressed her index finger to her palm which she explained did not just dampen signals but also created a fake generated conversation that would appeal to the bosses. “It is an implant that they lacked the ingenuity to conceive of”, she said. Max said, “my grandma always used to tell my mom that one word for hope was bicycle.  I live my life through and on my bike, I love my work in theory, and I will not be free until everyone is free.” 
            </p><p>
            
            Gazing out at the clear blue winter sky Sophia said “hope is the refusal to let evil ideas flourish, hope is you being our connection to world, hope is knowing that somewhere there is a person with some kind of power that is also doing the work to fix this dying world. Doing it for life and equality, not for control. Most days though, hope is a sapling coming up in ground that was dying, and a bird in spring sitting on its branch, and a moment of understanding shared by people”
            </p><p>
            
            The ride back to the city that night was (almost) entirely uneventful.  One of the techs that had worked on Max’s bike had added a hack. When a hidden switch was hit inside the right pogie it silenced the sirens and changed the display lights reactions to unknown proximity. Upon sensing wildlife, it emitted sound and smell that helped the rider blend into the background. 20 km out of town, just after a train had passed again, the alarms went off with a slight buzz of the handlebars. Signaling to the system that all was well and blending max into the forest while blocking their scent by masking it. A massive moose with two smaller ones ambled over the road not 4 meters in front of Max. They watched in awe and wonder, with a heart filling with a sense of connection to this land they restored that they had never felt. When they arrived home that evening, they slowly took their clothing off, unbound their breasts, and held their mother close.
            </p><p>
            
            Then, they told her everything about their day, figuring out how to navigate what came next would be their next big journey together.
