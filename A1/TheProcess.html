        <h1>Project Methods, and Expected Outputs</h1>
        <div>
            <p>This project is milestone for the course  CPSC 601 interactions with the future and it is a first iteration in process with multiple goals in multiple interconnected parts.</p>
            <p><b>First</b> the goal of this project as it aligns with the “That thing from the future prompt” is to consider what a future bicycle that uses fabric and ubiquitous sensing approaches could enable regarding bicycle landscape interactions. Beyond this the next step will also be to consider what data futures may exist beyond the individual. However, for this assignment this felt like the easy part to work with for stage one. </p>
            <p><b>Second</b>, I am using a method called Research/Creation. The creative goal of this project is both to iterate through the writing of, and through this process end with a reasonable creative output. In this case a science fiction story that relates to bicycle mobility data. This process, while only in the first phase, is part of that larger project output for this course project.  The story in this piece constitutes the first iteration of the process of creating a final creative output that explores themes of active mobility, disabled mobility and data in speculative fiction.  In this case stories that concaves of futures and bicycle data. I am also interested, as per some of my other research/creation work which I am currently writing a chapter on for my thesis, in exploring how the creative process of writing fiction can enhance my thinking about the subject of data in relation to active mobility.  I draw on the writing from both ideation and themes from this class and from my quantification class to examine and explore my own biases, perceptions and sense of position in the context of developing technologies. There is therefore both an identitarian as well as a structural context in which I try to situate these narratives</p>
            <p><b>The third goal</b> is to use this practice as part of a reach practice. There are two aims in this regard. First, I will use my reflections from this process along with what I find in other fictive works to ground my thinking through axiologies and orientations of the collection use and presentation of active mobility data.  Another part of the research aspect of this work is to provide me opportunity for further reflection on uses of research/creation for technoscientific practices that help establish a deeper sense of how positionality impacts our work.</p>
