<p title="Plane language summary text"> 
    In week one it was both cold and snowy. It was hard to be out in the cold and snow and have nerves in my legs that do not work well. I had to dress well. It was not very slippery, however walking was hard an tiring. The main theme I address in the reflective writing from the week is the extra emotional load of worrying about my body in the cold weather. My feet have a hard time feeling the cold.  </p>

    the 12th of January. The graph was a brutally cold day with a high of thirty-one degrees below zero high
     temperature. The image is looking out my office window, the light is bright, brisk and clear. There are
      lines of clear glass interspersed with lines of condensation. Through the condensation the outline of 
      a bright blue wooden char can be seen. There is much dried and dead shrubbery slightly visible in the 
      foreground.

<h2>Full text for week one</h2>
<p title="it is cold and snowy">It is cold. Cold and snowy. I find myself afraid for my damaged and growing nerves. I am not afraid only that my legs lack stability but also afraid for the risk of damage to their ongoing sensation of the world. I miss the fine-tuned awareness of just how cold my feet and legs are. I have spent so many early mornings in winter walking or biking as my body becomes increasingly numb. I have spent so many mornings cursing internally while smiling outwardly over the increasing coldness of my appendages. This winter, I grieve that I do not feel the gradual numbing of my limbs. 
</p>
<p title="cane step step">
    Cane, step, step. I feel a weary. Every step calculated. Every choice navigated. Every slightly irritated bus driver placated. Every indication of cold in my limbs carefully calibrated. 
</p>
<p title="we are corporal bodies">
    We are corporal beings in relationship to landscape— inhabiting this corporeality is a deeply local exercise. 

</p>

<p title="becoming with the land">
    Cane, step, step. I am myself becoming with this land. The tiny landscape that is available to me is dominated by human construction: a human construction that is not made for my body as it is today. 
</p>
<p title="on friday">
So, on Friday, in the comfort of my home—thinking about how the frigid air protects my dear pine tree from pine beetles— I stare out my window, watching the world and observing. Lines of ice on glass can be a complete story of the world and a reflection of our position in it; ephemeral and constant; constrained and abundant; personal and universal.

<h2> Images and description for week 1</h2>

<h3> Photo of the woven textile for week 1: photo by Yalda Jahan Panah</h3>


<img src="Images/week 1 photo.jpg" width=100% alt="The first week the textile background stayed 
consistent with the color of the non-exposed background. The black line indicating the 
temperature on the chart falls sharply across the week. 
This fall indicates a change in temperature outside. 
The beginning of the week the temperatures are indicated at the 
high mid point of the graph, indicating a daytime high of around zero, 
at the end of the week the lows are around 32 degrees Celsius below zero. 
In contrast to this the white bars that are made up of crossed stiches increase 
in size at the beginning of the week. By the end of the week there is  around 
10 cm of snow accumulated on the ground growing from  five at the beginning 
of the week. At the right end of the week to the right side of the weeks 
section there are samples of the yarn used for sensing dangeling down beside 
the written summary of the weeks experience.">
