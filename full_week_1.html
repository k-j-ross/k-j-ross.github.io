<h1><center>Week 1</center></h1>
<div>
<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p> 
    In week one it was both cold and snowy. It was hard to be out in the cold and snow and have nerves in my legs that do not work well. I had to dress well. It was not very slippery, however. The main theme I address in the reflective writing from the week is the extra emotional load of worrying about my body as it is now in the cold weather.

<h2>Full text for week 1</h2>
<p>It is cold. Cold and snowy. In the freezing depths, I find myself afraid for my damaged and growing nerves. I am not afraid that my legs lack stability but afraid for the risk of damage to their ongoing sensation of the world. I never thought I would miss the fine-tuned awareness of just how cold my feet and legs are. I have spent so many early mornings in winter walking or biking as my body becomes increasingly numb. I have spent so many mornings cursing internally while smiling outwardly over the increasing coldness of my appendages. This winter, I grieve that I do not feel the gradual numbing of my limbs. 
</p>
<p>
    I never realised how much I would simply revel in being able to move myself around; half the speed does not seem to mean half the pleasure. I have the right gear to keep me warm—I am equipped. But I am not attuned to how to dress for my slow movement. Still, I did not realize how much the discomfort of slow chilling is in fact a joy. 
</p>
<p>
    In such deep cold there is no veneer of water between me and the ice. The air is too cold to melt water on the surface of ice, and there is nothing to make this dance with sidewalks one of fluid dynamics. I am finding great comfort in the deep cold. In this cold, it is just ice to boot grips. Yes, there was some trepidation in my movement, but this week the cold gives me stability. 
</p>
<p>
    In the months leading up to this week, I have been internally conflicted. I have felt a deepening conflict stemming from the current drought. I was pleased with the increasing freedom of my movement and concerned for the plants that I love and the landscape I live within. As I hobble through un-shoveled snow; cane, step, step; cane, step, step; I worry that it is not enough moisture— not deep enough, not thick enough, not consistent enough— to keep the ecosystem healthy. 
</p>

<p>
    Cane, step, step. <br>
I feel a weariness of a new kind. <br>
Every step calculated. <br>
Every choice to come or go navigated.<br>
Every slightly irritated bus driver placated.<br>
Every indication of cold in my limbs carefully calibrated.<br>
We are corporal bodies in relationship to landscape— inhabiting this corporeality is a deeply local exercise. 

</p>

<p>
    Cane, step, step.<br> 
    I am myself becoming with this land. The tiny landscape available to me is dominated by human construction: a human construction that is not made for my body as it is today.  
</p>
<p>
    So, on Friday, in the comfort of my home—thinking about how the frigid air protects my dear pine tree from pine beetles— I stare out my window, watching the world and observing. Even simple lines of ice on glass can be a complete story of the world and a reflection of our position in it; ephemeral and constant; constrained and abundant; personal and universal.
