    <h1><center> Week 4: January twenty-ninth to February fourth </center></h1>
<div>
<h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p>
    This week was the hardest week to get around. Very few people would give me space on the bus and one bus driver pulled out before letting me sit down. I wonder if the warmer dryer weather makes people do fewer nice things for others.

<h2>Full text for week four </h2>


<p>
    This week the sidewalks are largely dry, and the air is largely warm. My journeys in landscape are beautiful and full of the lovely sounds. 
</p>
<p>
    This week I find myself grasping the rail on my bus as it pulls away from my stop before I can sit down. I am afraid to fall. I am afraid a fall could lead me to bleed so severely I need to be hospitalized again. 
</p>
<p>
    This week I find myself having to directly ask people to please give me a seat. I feel conflicted doing so (what if they have an invisible disability, I think). When I ask for a seat people just sit and blankly stare at me.
</p>
<p>
    When it was cold and snowy it seemed like everyone was keen to look out for others. When it warmed and was icy, people moved out of my way on the sidewalk. This week, my needs seem invisible. 
</p>
<p>
    If I were a spider this would be week of dry land turned into a world of torrential rivers. I am not a spider, so it is instead a week of unexpected sounds, the slow running tinkle of water through the spaces I inhabit. An omnipresent reminder of how to get to nose creek. Runoff is as transient as life; runoff is a marker to orient myself by. Yet the drying of sidewalks and the shifting of the world do not change the exhaustion caused by a bus driver moving before I am seated or needing to demand a spot to sit down on a full bus. The social contracts that keep my neighbours walks clear seem to somehow fade when I step across the river, through the bus door, and into the mythical land of public transit. The line between self and inclusion is socially demarcated as are the barriers between the sidewalk and the road. They are dynamic, sometimes fluid, sometimes mounded ice, sometimes a simple alteration of elevation. But always present. 
</p>
<p>
    In the warm weather I find the social infrastructure of this city profoundly cold, increasingly disabling. I want to cry. I want to scream. I want to preach. Instead, I take the seat I must fight for. Shrinking myself too much. Thanking others too much. I sit down and try to make myself small.
</p>
<p>
    I close the week with legs exhausted and weak from the exertion. I close the week thinking about the time in the fall when an elderly woman got up to give me her seat. I close the week choosing to shift my gaze next week. No matter how hard it is I will find joy, I will find a salve to this anger and frustration. I will honor my frustration, but I will not let it consume me.

There is a huge pool of water surrounding the bae of two deciduous trees running many meters in length. There is a snow pile on the left-hand side of the image, towards the sidewalk, this snow seems to be actins as a dike to keep the water on the lawn. " >
